In this project, I'll learn to create a versatile player controller, design levels, implement a parallax effect, and develop camera controllers. I'll add enemies, create an engaging combat system with mechanics like dashes and counterattacks, and move on to advanced RPG systems including crafting, stats, and elemental effects. I'll also develop UI elements and a save system to manage progress. Finally, I'll polish my game with visual effects and publish it. By the end, I'll have the skills to create my own unique RPG game.
